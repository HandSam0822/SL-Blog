  There're 4 different types of NoSQL database schema, respectively key-value,
  document-oriented, column family, and graph. This article will walk through
  the pros and cons of each schema design

# \[NoSQL] 4 types of NoSQL database schema

### Key-Value (Redis, DynamoDB)

_Each key is associated with a single value._

_Use Case_&#x20;

1. Small data size with flexible data storage.&#x20;
2. Data model is very simple

Downsides ðŸ‘Ž&#x20;

1. Data size limitation: Redis store data in-memory; DynamoDB has 400 kb limitation.
2. Not supportive for complex data processing such as grouping

### Document-oriented (MongoDB, CouchDB)

_Each document contains a set of key-value pairs. MongoDB use BSON to store data while CouchDB use JSON_&#x20;

_Use Case_

1. The data schema is semi-structured&#x20;

ðŸ‘Ž

1. It's not design for performing complex analytical queries&#x20;
2. When there're mostly read-only use cases, column-family is better

### Column-family (Cassandra, BigTable, Hbase)

_Each keyspace(database) has column-family(table). Each column family has multiple rows(row), each rows contains a row-key and different number of column, in each column contains a column name, value, and timestamp._

Use case

1. When data between different table has high relationship like a relational database
2. High-traffic read and analytic request&#x20;

### Graph (Neo4j)&#x20;

_Data is represented as nodes and edges._&#x20;

Use case&#x20;

1. If data has complex relationships such as social network, which contains **a set of entities and their relationship**, a graph database provides powerful traversal and querying capabilities.
2. If you need to run **graph algorithms** such as shortest path, centrality or community detection a graph database is the best choice.
