  Serverless enables developers to focus less on infrastructure. They can deploy
  their service (Function, Event) to cloud providers such as AWS and Azure, and
  the provider manages the all the rest

# \[Backend] What is Serverless

Serverless enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. In a Serverless application, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. In other words, developers don't need to know about server architecture, such as load balancers and firewalls, and can stay focused on the business logic to deliver more value.

Itâ€™s important to note that Serverless doesn't mean that there are no servers involved. Servers are still running the code, but the tasks associated with infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer.

Another benefit of Serverless is that we pay for what we use. We are only charged for the amount of times our code is triggered, instead of the time we have deployed our service.
