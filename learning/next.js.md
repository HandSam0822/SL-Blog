# Next.js

Next.js is a popular JavaScript library that is designed to make it easy to build **server-rendered** React applications. Since I have been familiar with React and desire to take my skills to the next level, Next.js is a good fit for me. It can not only improve the performance and SEO of my applications with some handy features such as SSR SRG but also elevate the developer experiences with file-system structure routing.
