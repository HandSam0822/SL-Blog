# API Design and Implementation

The inspiration for exploring different API designs is from the 17480/17680 API Design and Implementation, one of the CMU courses that I have taken. I would like to bring into some of my big takeaways in this course, and also some extended content that I am interested in but doesn't be introduced in the course.
