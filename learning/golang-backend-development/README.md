# Golang Backend Development

In terms of my experience in backend development, I spent roughly 50% of my time on Python Django, 40% on Node.js, and 10% on Java Spring. Although each framework has their benefit, none of them satisfies my need of&#x20;

1. Building scalable and efficient backend services&#x20;
2. Clean syntax and built-in support with concurrency
3. Small application file size

As a result, I want to learn Golang because&#x20;

1. Static typing with way shorter compile time compared to C, Java
2. Design for multi-processor and Internet
3. Simple code
